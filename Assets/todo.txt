Todo:
	- (Done) Create New Tank Model
	- (Done) Reorganize Models, Materials, Textures
	- Add sounds
		-- Bullet-Wall
		-- Tank explode
		-- Landmine explode
	- Add visuals
		-- Tank explode
		-- Landmine explode
		-- New bullet trail (maybe multiple?)



Pressing:




Issues:
	- Bullets sometimes pass through walls or destroy themselves before bouncing (valve plz fix)
	- Projectile Manager needs better ID distribution system

	- ***new unity prefab workflow will fix this issue*** 
		Nametags don't disappear when you die in soccer (the tanks are now seperate prefabs so it just needs to be updated) (could this actually be a feature?)

Ideas:
	- Gamemodes:
		-- Save the Tank
		-- Soccer
		-- Capture the flag
		-- Batte Royale
		-- One in the chamber
		-- kill confirmed?

		-- Fun Ideas
			-- Players can only die from landmines. Projectiles still explode landmines (maybe a short fuse?)
			-- Can only kill from bankshots

	- bullet shaped projectiles
	- tank path tracks
	- different camera perspectives (how to?)
	- tutorial level at some point
