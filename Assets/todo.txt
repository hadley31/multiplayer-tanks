Todo:
	- Create New Tank Model
	- Reorganize Models, Materials, Textures
	- Add sounds
		-- Bullet-Wall
		-- Tank explode
		-- Landmine explode
	- Add visuals
		-- Tank explode
		-- Landmine explode
		-- New bullet trail (maybe multiple)



Pressing:




Issues:
	- Bullets sometimes pass through walls or destroy themselves before bouncing (valve plz fix)
	- Projectile Manager needs better ID distribution system

	- Nametags don't disappear when you die in soccer (the tanks are now seperate prefabs so it just needs to be updated)

Ideas:
	- Gamemodes:
		-- Save the Tank
		-- Soccer
		-- Batte Royale
		-- One in the chamber
	- bullet shaped projectiles
	- tank path tracks
