Issues:
	- Bullets sometimes pass through walls or destroy themselves before bouncing (valve plz fix)
	- Colliding bullets on non-master clients do not destroy for a good bit
		-- consider "destroying" on local client and wait for confirmation by server
	- Projectile Manager sometimes destroys wrong projectile





Ideas:
	- Gamemodes:
		-- Save the Mad Tank
		-- Soccer
		-- Batte Royale
		-- One in the chamber
	- bullet shaped projectiles
	- tank path tracks
